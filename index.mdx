title: "Introduction: What is Momo? "
description: "Momo gives your apps long-term memory. It acts as a connector for apps like Gmail, Slack, Linear, Github, and more so that they have persistent memory, automatically creating and updating chats and events into a unified memory layer."
---

## How does it work?

To put it easily, Momo's connectors are like MCPs that allow devs to build a memory layer for each app.

- Connect your app with Momo.
- Momo extracts relevant information based on the person, entity, action from that chat mesage or event and builds a real-time evolving memory.
- As your apps memory constantly evolves, connect it with other apps to build a unified organizational memory layer.

## Why it matters

- **LLMs forget everything.** You can’t build apps that track ongoing work, preferences, or evolving context without a real memory layer.
- **Real workflows break without continuity.** Unified inboxes, company knowledge graphs, and auto-updating tools (like Salesforce or Linear) are impossible if the system can’t remember past events.
- **Momo unlocks these products.** By giving Gmail (and later Slack, Linear, Salesforce) persistent memory, apps can finally maintain state, update themselves, and understand what happened over time.
