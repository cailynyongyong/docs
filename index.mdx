title: "Introduction: What is Momo? "
description: "Momo makes sure your team never forgets important work.
It connects tools like Gmail, Slack, GitHub, and Linear, and automatically remembers conversations, decisions, and events in one shared memory."

## How does it work?

Momo connects to the tools your team already uses, starting with **Gmail, Slack, and GitHub**.

- Each connector listens to messages and events in real time and sends them to Momo.
- Momo automatically extracts **decisions, ownership, people, and ongoing work** from those conversations and turns them into structured, evolving memory.
- As activity continues across apps, Momo keeps this memory up to date, so context isn’t lost when threads get long, teammates change, or work spans multiple tools.

## Why it matters

**Slack and Gmail weren’t built to remember work.** Decisions get lost in threads, ownership disappears, and teams waste time re-explaining context.

**When there’s no shared memory, work slows down.** Onboarding takes longer, handoffs break, and teams repeat the same conversations week after week.

**Momo turns conversations into shared team memory.** It automatically captures decisions and context from Slack and Gmail so teams can review what was decided, who owns what, and why without searching or asking again.
