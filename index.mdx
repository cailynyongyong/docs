title: "Introduction: What is Momo? "
description: "Momo gives your apps long-term memory. It acts as a connector for apps like Gmail, Slack, Linear, Github, and more so that they have persistent memory, automatically creating and updating chats and events into a unified memory layer."
---

## How does it work? 

To put it easily, Momo's connectors are like MCPs that allow devs to build a memory layer for each app. 

- Connect your apps with API (or we can build a better service than the current MCP framework cuz it fucking sucks)

## Why it matters

- **LLMs forget everything.** You can’t build apps that track ongoing work, preferences, or evolving context without a real memory layer.
- **Real workflows break without continuity.** Unified inboxes, company knowledge graphs, and auto-updating tools (like Salesforce or Linear) are impossible if the system can’t remember past events.
- **Momo unlocks these products.** By giving Gmail (and later Slack, Linear, Salesforce) persistent memory, apps can finally maintain state, update themselves, and understand what happened over time.
